  <p class="lead">It Just Works.</p>

  <p>SiteHound is a Javascript library that sends user and event data directly to your analytics tooling via Segment.com, or directly to Mixpanel. (Support for other analytics libraries can be added via adaptors.)</p>

  <p>SiteHound provides a bunch of smart functionality behind the scenes to ensure you have the correct and accurate data you need. You can safely avoid having to reinvent the wheel just to track your site, and not regret missing the data necessary to answer key questions about your user behaviour.</p>

  <p>You can use SiteHound if you need:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>To set up your event tracking for the first time</strong> - SiteHound is the quickest way to implement comprehensive website analytics tracking.</li>
    <li><strong>Full user attribution data</strong> for your marketing analytics (first-, last- and mid-click attribution, landing page &amp; referrer data).</li>
    <li><strong>Detailed user engagement data</strong>, so you can easily segment your user data by attributes such as when they were first seen, number of sessions, and depth within session (by time and/or page views).</li>
    <li><strong>Easy user-level analytics</strong>, linked back to pre-signup anonymous behaviour, without having to wrangle with your own <code>identify()</code> and <code>alias()</code> calls - the <em>single biggest area for mistakes</em> when implementing tracking manually.</li>
    <li><strong>Tracking that works with single-page sites</strong> based on javascript frameworks such as Angular.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Already tracking data?</strong> SiteHound plays nice with existing tracking - so is likely a great fit whether you're just setting up your analytics tracking for the first time, or looking to take your existing tracking to the next level to answer more key questions about your user acquisition and behaviour.</p>

  <p>SiteHound was developed based on experience with the analytics tracking needs of many tens of sites of different kinds, including companies within the 500 Startups Distro Dojo programs.</p>
